Difference between the maximum and minimum average of all k-length continuous subarrays

Input: arr[ ] = {3, 8, 9, 15}, K = 2Output: 6.5

Explanation: All subarrays of length 2 are {3, 8}, {8, 9}, {9, 15} and their averages are (3+8)/2 = 5.5, (8+9)/2 = 8.5, and (9+15)/2 = 12.0 respectively.

Therefore, the difference between the maximum(=12.0) and minimum(=5.5) is 12.0 -5.5 = 6.5.
