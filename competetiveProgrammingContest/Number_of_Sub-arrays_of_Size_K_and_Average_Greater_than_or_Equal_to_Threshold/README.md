Given an array of integers arr and two integers k and threshold.

Return the number of sub-arrays of size k and average greater than or equal to a threshold.

Input: arr = [2,2,2,2,5,5,5,8], k = 3, threshold = 4

Output: 3

Explanation: Sub-arrays [2,5,5],[5,5,5] and [5,5,8] have averages 4, 5 and 6 respectively. All other sub-arrays of size 3 have averages less than 4 (the threshold).
